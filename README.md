Colombian graduated from the Gimnasio Bilingue Campestre Marie Curie in 2018, where I had one of the best results of the state exam since I was among the 3% of the best scores in the country. Also, I did my degree thesis in my last school year, which was about solar panels and was among the best thesis of the institution.
 I strengthened my English for six months in Canada, and I took the Toefl exam, which I categorized with B2 English. Later, I began to take classes in the computer science career at Keiser University. I was awarded a scholarship for my academic and sports performance, obtaining a cumulative GPA of 3.9 in my first year. After that year of study, I transferred to Rollins College, where I am currently studying my junior year of computer science and mathematics with an academic scholarship
